    r"""This is an extension of the CrossEntropyLoss provided by pytorch. Please check pytorch documentation

    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each class.
            If given, has to be a Tensor of size `C`
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when reduce is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
            and does not contribute to the input gradient. When :attr:`size_average` is
            ``True``, the loss is averaged over non-ignored targets.
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will
            be applied, ``'mean'``: the weighted mean of the output is taken,
            ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in
            the meantime, specifying either of those two args will override
            :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``
        y_train (np.asarray[int], Tensor, optional): All train example's corresponding label
        s_train (np.asarray[int], Tensor, optional): All train example's corresponding sensitive attribute. This means if there
            are 2 sensitive attributes, with each of them being binary. For instance gender - (male and female) and
            age (above 45, below 45). Total unique sentive attributes are 4.
        fairness_measure (string): Currently we support "equal_odds", "equal_opportunity", and "accuracy_parity".
        epsilon (float, optional): The slack which is allowed for the final fairness level.
        fairness_rate (float, optional): Parameter which intertwines current fairness weights with sum of previous fairness rates.

        >>> target = torch.empty(10, dtype=torch.long).random_(2)

        >>> loss = CrossEntropyLoss(y_train = target, s_train = s, fairness_measure = 'equal_odds')
